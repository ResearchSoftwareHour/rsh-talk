# Lessons learned

- We wanted big live audience but we did not sufficiently advertise

- No shortage of topics/ideas

- It was an evening and weekend thing

- It is too scary to join with something unfinished
> "Watchers can take part by suggesting ideas, .emph[contribute code] or problems
> to discuss on stream, or even joining to directly .emph[be a part of the show]."

- It is effective to have the videos and refer to them when helping
  researchers

# Future: We will probably restart!

- Short sessions

- Idea: **"What do you know now that you wish somebody taught you earlier?"** (guests or survey)

- In each episode we would discuss one of those

- Live record during work time (1 hour preparation time)

- Do better at social media and outreach

- Streamline the production to have more time for content

- **Please get in touch if you find this interesting**: <radovan.bast@uit.no>
